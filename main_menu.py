    GAME REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS FILE TO WORK:

        - Game must be put into main function using
            if __name__ == "__main__"
        
        - Game must import games.jacob_game.GameOver
            When mainloop is broken:
                call pygame.display.quit()
                and then raise GameOver
        
        - Pygame must be imported as 'pygame' and nothing 
            else e.g. 'pg'

        - Any other local modules used in game must also be 
            imported here e.g. game settings, and must be 
            imported in original file with full path
            e.g. games.jacob_game.settings
    
    THERE IS ONE PROBLEM (if using a local import):
    
        The games no longer run on their own and must be run 
        through main_menu.py
        
        This is because in order for exec(file.read()) to work,
        local imports have to use their full relative path,
        e.g. games.jacob_game.settings
        
        However, when main.py is run on its own, 
        (python games/jacob_game/main.py), the shell
        has no idea what games is when encountering
        games.jacob_game.settings
        
        This will most likely just have to be a compromise.
