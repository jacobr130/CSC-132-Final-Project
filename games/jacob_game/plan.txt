Implement platforms:  -- I chose the wrong major
    - Spawn platforms randomly (random amount per row,
      random horizontal and vertical padding between, 
      randomize platform length)
        - Up and down and side to side movement 

Implement constant upward screen scrolling

UPDATE GFX  -- Pretty much done

GFX Needed:
    - Player character  -- Done
    - Background  -- Done
    - Floor? (only shows up at beginning) -- Done? (looks like ass)
    - Platforms with various lengths               
    - Powerups possibly
