A game system featuring preloaded retro games enhanced with improved user experience in visuals and physical gameplay. An innovative
interactive game console with three different physical game cartridges was implemented to elevate the gaming experience to a higher level.
The games were developed using the Python language and the Pygame library, harnessing the logic of Python to ensure a seamless gaming
experience for each individual game.
